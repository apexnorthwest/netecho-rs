# Contribution and Development
All rules and guidelines in this document are expected to be followed by
contributors. Any pull requests that are found not to follow these rules will
be rejected. No worries though, we won't be mean about it. :) If your PR is
rejected due to a contribution guideline issue, we'll do our best to be clear
about why and what you can do to resolve it. We're all on the same team.

## Guidelines for Contributing
### Rule 1: Style and Linting
This project uses standard rust conventions. You should have an appropriate
amount of comments to make clear what your code does without going into too
much detail. Additionally, we expect the code to pass machete, cargo check,
cargo clippy, and be in line with cargo standard format. You can do the following
to format and check your code locally without building the container:

```shell
# Run these once to set up the toolchain
rustup update stable
rustup default stable
rustup component add clippy
cargo install cargo-machete

# Run the formatter and checks. This takes a while the first time
cargo fmt
cargo check
cargo clippy
cargo machete
```

### Rule 2: External tooling
Any additional libraries or features you want to add to the manifest must be
justified and you will be asked to explain why it's the right choice.

This image will be packed as a static binary in a scratch container to prevent
exposure surface and minimize the final image size.

### Rule 3: Vulnerability Scanning
Multiple vulnerability and code quality scanners are in use on this project.
Alerts from any of them should be considered mandatory prior to merging a pull
request against the project. It is expected that you as a contributor will have
compiled the project container image and run the test suite prior to opening the
PR.

Should you discover a critical vulnerability, you are encouraged to report it via
<admin@apexnorthwest.com>. Should the maintainers fail to respond within 30 days,
you should open an issue on this repo. If an unpatched vulnerability is found in a
library or included binary, please open an issue right away with the appropriate details.

### Rule 4: Use of AI tools
Use of AI assisted coding tools is acceptable, but all code is expected to be
of high quality and comply with this standards document. All code should be
reviewed, tested, and understood by the contributor. You as the developer are
responsible for the code you submit, AI assisted or otherwise. You, as a developer,
must be able to explain and defend your code when asked. You own the code, not
your tools or agents.

Pull requests submitted by an automated agent or code written entirely by an
agent are very likely to be rejected. Autonomous AI agents are powerful, but
at this time they are still prone to subtle errors and misunderstanding of
the finer semantics of many applications. Bugs introduced by agents can be
difficult to debug, especially without anyone who knows how their code works.

This section is subject to change as these technologies develop rapidly. Our
stance is to remain conservative on what we permit. While these tools are
very valuable, and this project's maintainers do use some of them, there is
tangible value in having people who know and deeply understand code. As in all
things in life, balance is important.

By way of disclosure, the primary maintainers of this project use ai assisted
tooling to improve autocompletion, bug hunting, and boilerplate creation.
Autonomous agents were not used in the creation of this application, nor was
a large amount of code written by any ai model.

### Opening a Pull Request
Your pull request should explain what problem you're trying to solve and link to an
Issue if there's one that you expect to be fixed by the change. If it's a new feature,
you must provide background on why the feature is needed and an example of both the
problem and how to use the new feature.
